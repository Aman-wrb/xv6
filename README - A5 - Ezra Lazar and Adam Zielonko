README - A5: Ezra Lazar and Adam Zielonko

To make, one of:

	$ make clean && make qemu # SELECTION=NFU
	$ make clean && make qemu SELECTION=FIFO
	$ make clean && make qemu SELECTION=NONE

To run test:

	$ myMemTest



It seems as though NFU is fundamentally broken, but the others at least mostly work.
